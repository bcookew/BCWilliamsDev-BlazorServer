Since then I have spent about 12 years in concert and event production as a warehouse manager, rigger, outdoor event structure designer, and project manager. I picked up coding again in 2020 as the world of live events ground to a halt. I rediscovered a love of it through Codecademy's online course in Python 3 and have been studying everything I can get my hands on since then. In 2022 I attended the Coding Dojo Full-Time Software Development Bootcamp and learned full stack basics in C# .NET, MERN, and Python w/Flask. They helped me fall in love with C# after quite a few years of sticking to Python, and since then my love of coding has only grown as I take on both personal and professional projects."
